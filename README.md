QuickDB was used to generate the entity relationship diagram, the export was used to generate the schema. Minor corrections were made afterwards.

The results of the queries were saved in the Results folders as CSVs.

If trying to replicate, I used PostgreSQL and imported the data CSVs into it rather than use an insert statement etc.
